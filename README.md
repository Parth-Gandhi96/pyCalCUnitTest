## IS 601 : Python - Create a Calculator

### Check List:

#### Class implementation
- [X] Implement Calculator Class 
- [X] 6 operations : Add/Subtract/Multiply/Division/Square/Square Root 
- [X] Rough testing using main class

#### TestClass implementation
- [X] setUpClass : for initilizing the object of calculator before (only once) all the test methods
- [X] Write unit test for each object method in Calculator class
- [X] Provide test-report after for each test method (how many passed and failed test cases)

#### Later actions for removing redundant code:
- [X] Make modularized class for reading data from file for each test case

#### Docker containerization
- [X] Dockerfile : python setup, copy all code and test files, entry point
- [X] Add Docker Config in PyCharm
- [X] Build the image, and execute the container
